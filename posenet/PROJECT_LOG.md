# Pose Detection Project Log

## Project Overview
- **Project Name**: Pose Detection using React
- **Technology Stack**: React, JavaScript, PoseNet (planned)
- **Start Date**: [Current Date]
- **Goal**: Create a web application for real-time pose detection

## Development Timeline

### [Current Date] - Project Initialization
**What was done:**
- Created React app using Create React App
- Set up basic project structure
- Created project log file for tracking progress
- Started adding pose detection imports in App.js

**Problems faced:**
- None yet

**Solutions implemented:**
- Used Create React App for quick setup
- Organized project structure
- Added imports for TensorFlow.js, PoseNet, and react-webcam

**Next steps:**
- Install missing dependencies (TensorFlow.js, PoseNet, react-webcam)
- Set up camera access
- Create basic UI components

## Technical Decisions

### Framework Choice
- **React**: Chosen for component-based architecture and ease of development
- **JavaScript**: Using JS instead of TypeScript as per preference

### Planned Dependencies
- TensorFlow.js
- PoseNet or MediaPipe Pose
- React Webcam (for camera access)
